## Project Overview

"The four painters" is a video artwork generated using deep learning technology, where AI models learn and imitate the unique styles of four world-renowned painters: **Vincent van Gogh**, **Claude Monet**, **Pablo Picasso**, and **Salvador Dalí**.

## Technical Implementation

The project employs advanced **Style Transfer** and **Generative Adversarial Network** (GAN) techniques to transform modern video content into dynamic artworks with the styles of classic painters.

### Key Features

- **Multi-style Support**: Simultaneously supports four different artistic styles
- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized algorithms ensure smooth video generation
- **High-quality Output**: Maintains original video content while perfectly blending painter style characteristics

## Creative Concept

This project explores the boundaries between **artificial intelligence and artistic creation**, demonstrating how technology can help us reinterpret and understand classic artistic styles. Each frame is carefully processed to create a new visual experience while preserving the spirit of the original works.

## Use Cases

- Art exhibitions and displays
- Art education in educational settings
- Creative video production
- Digital art collections
